bbPress-permalinks-with-id
==========================

Change bbPress permalinks. Topic and forum ID instead of slug

This plugin for WordPress and bbPress converts default permalinks with topic and forum slugs to permalinks with ID's. Examples:

 * /forums/forum/FORUM_SLUG &rarr; /forums/forum/FORUM_ID
 * /forums/topic/TOPIC_SLUG &rarr; /forums/topic/TOPIC_ID
